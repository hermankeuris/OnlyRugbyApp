\subsection{Ruck}
		During game time (i.e. while the OnlyRugby app is being used to log the information of a match currently being played ) the Ruck function will be used each time the ball is on the ground and players are crowded around it.
		During this time, they must use their feet to maneuver it to the back of the rear player's feet, at which point it may be picked up. The Ruck function works as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Once the user has pressed the button to log the ruck's information they are redirected to a page which asks them to indicate which
			team won the ruck by pressing either of two buttons which each have the names of the respective teams on them.
		\end{enumerate}
	On all of the above described pages there are also buttons labeled 'Cancel' (to cancel logging the ruck) and 'Back' which redirects the user to the previous page and ignores the information that was logged on the page it is now leaving.
