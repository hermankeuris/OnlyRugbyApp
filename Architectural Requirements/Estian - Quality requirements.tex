\subsection{Quality Requirements}
	The following quality requirements are in order of the most important to least important (can be changed).	
	\subsubsection{Critical:}
	\subsubsection*{Usability}
	The average individual should be able to use the OnlyRugby app without any prior training and not be discouraged from using the system again.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The OnlyRugby app's interface must be efficient, easy to use, and intuitive to navigate. To accomplish this the interface should be kept minimalistic and logical to allow the user to easily identify and use the services provided by the app.
		\item Initially only English needs to be supported, however the system must allow for translations to other internationally spoken languages (To allow for an increased user base once the system is made available for regions outside South Africa)
		\item Usability tests will involve typical users using the OnlyRugby app in a realistic (yet simulated) environment. Tests will be recorded on video as this medium provides task completion time and allows for observation of the user's behaviour, emotions, and difficulties while using the app.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection*{Scalability}
	Since the system is planned to be made available for use internationally, it is vital to the success of the system that a large number of users can be accommodated.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Management of resources available to the app across a range of Android devices needs to scale to ensure that every user of the OnlyRugby app will be presented with a satisfactory experience.
		\item The system must be able to operate effectively under the load of one user per team for all teams that are registered on the OnlyRugby social platform. (Ball park figure of ~1500 after complete deployment in South Africa, 1526 clubs registered with the Rugby Union of South Africa)
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Important:}

	\subsubsection*{Availability}
	Due to the live data capturing requirements of the application and the future planned international release it is important that the OnlyRugby system is always accessible to the user, at the very least during all rugby games registered on the OnlyRugby social platform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The OnlyRugby app must be accessible on the multitude of android devices running Android 4.0 and above.
		\item Data should be captured and stored locally before being pushed to the server in order to avoid data loss should the device being used lose connection to the server for any reason. This way even if the server is down the core functionality of the app is still usable.
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection*{Integrability}
	The system must be able to communicate with the OnlyRugby social platform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Must integrate with the social platform's database concerning teams, players, and scheduled games for retrieval of display information. If communication is not possible (e.g. a loss of data connection) then default/place-holder values (e.g. Team 1, Player number 23) should be used for local storage and replaced with actual data once the connection is restored, but before data is pushed to the server.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection*{Maintainability}
	
	
	\subsubsection*{Testability}
	
	\subsubsection*{Monitorability and Auditability}

	\subsubsection{Nice to have:}
	
	\subsubsection*{Security}		
	
	\subsubsection*{Performance requirements}
