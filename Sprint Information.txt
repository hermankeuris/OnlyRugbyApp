NOTES TO ALL:
* Use dummy data where your function relies on functions still to be implemented.

* If there are any questions or objections, problems or impedements, please ask the group for ideas or 
	assistance. We will gladly help. If you are afraid to voice your opinion or to raise an objection in front 
	of the group, contact group leader privately. He will handle the matter with sensitivity and care and 
	make sure you remain anonymous if the need be.
	
* If there are any problems with team members etc, contact group leader as well if you cannot resolve 
	the issue yourself.
	
* Any and all communication with the client are to go through or to be approved by the group leader first, 
	unless the client initiated contact with you initially.
	
* Please feel free in this group to voice your opinions or concerns. If you have an idea, share it. If you 
	have a better way of doing something, explain it. If you don't like something, say so. Once again, if you 
	feel uncomfortable talking in front of the whole group or don't want anyone to know the idea is yours 
	or that a concern came from you, feel free to talk to the group leader about it. Your name will not be 
	mentioned if you don't want it to be.
	
* Have fun!
