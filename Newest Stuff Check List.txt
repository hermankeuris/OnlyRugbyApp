Please check that the line-outs' and turnover's removal is correct.
When removing red/yellow cards, should their card status(boolean) be revoked?
List page doesnt reload, any way to fix/circumvent?
Player select- who scored the conversion?

Yellow/red card's removal should put player back - I will implement

Add substitutions to events - I will implement

Final report page + upload button - suggestion

Further, please look through the code for any errors. It isn't final, but what is in place should
be correct.
